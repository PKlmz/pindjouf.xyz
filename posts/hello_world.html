    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This post is an introduction to my page.</p>
    <p>My goal is to make it a log of my thoughts and goals while providing valuable insights. <br> Although some might think that simple content such as the one on this page might be outdated, I think it still has it's place. In a world full of overstimulation it can be a quiet place to truly digest information.
    </p>
    <p>I have to let the work speak for itself and become a practitioner of the principles outlayed in the cult of done manifesto.
    </p>
    <p>Today is my 21st birthday and this marks a symbolic start for me.</p>
